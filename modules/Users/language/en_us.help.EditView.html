<h1>Users</h1>
<p> Use this page to view or update your information and settings such as name, address, locale settings, and email options. Administrators can also create user records for new employees.

<p>Enter or update information in the following fields:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the top section, enter the user name, the login name and password, and the user status.
<li>In the User Settings section, select the appropriate box to specify whether the user is a Regular user, a System Administrator, a Group User, or a Portal-only User.
<ul>
<li>A Regular User is a Sugar user without administration privileges.
<li>A System Administrator is a user who has full access to all Sugar records and full control over administering and developing the application. 
<li>Group User is a bucket that is used for inbound emails, which are then distributed to users for action.
<li>A Portal-Only User is used by portals created in Sugar to access the system.
</ul>
<li>In the Email Options section, enter the user's email addresses and specify whether it is the primary email address or the reply-to email address used to sent an automated response to emails.
<br>From the Email Client drop-down list, specify whether the email client is the default Sugar email client or an external email client. The user can configure the email client in the Emails module.
<li>In the User Information sub-panel, specify the user's employee status, title, department, phone numbers, IM (Instant Messenger) type and ID. You can add comments in the Notes field, if necessary.
<li>In the User Settings section, you can enable email notifications to the user when a record is assigned to that person. You can also enable automatic reminders for upcoming meetings and calls. If the user has access to the Sugar Plug-in for Microsoft Word, you can enable the Mail Merge option. You can also specify the user’s Offline Client status.
<li>In the Locale Settings section, specify the default settings for date, time, currency, and saluation formats.



<li>In the Calendar Options section, you can enter a Publish Key to prevent others from publishing the user's calendar without authorization. 
<li>In the Layout Options section, you can limit access to Sugar modules by granting the user access only to specific modules, depending on the tasks that the user needs to perform. By default, the user has access to all the modules. To hide a module from the user's view, move the module tab to the Hide Tabs list using the Arrow buttons. Similarly, to display a module to a user, move it from the Hide Tabs list to the Display Tabs list.<br>
To apply these settings to all users, move the modules from the Hide Tabs list to the Remove Tabs list. To move up a module, select the module in the Display Tabs list and click the up arrow; to move down the module, click the down arrow.
In the Number of Tabs field, specify the maximum number of module tabs to display.
<li>To create the user, click <span class="helpButton">Save</span>; click <span class="helpButton">Cancel</span> to exit the page without saving your changes.
</ol>
