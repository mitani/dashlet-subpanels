<h1>Merge Records</h1>

<p>You can merge duplicate records into a single record to update and clean up your data. The system treats the first record that you select as the primary record but you can change to a different record. Before the duplicate records are deleted, related information such as activities, history, contacts are moved from the duplicate records to the primary record.</p>
<ul>
<li>To specify one of the duplicate records as the primary record, click <span class="helpButton">Set as Primary</span> above the duplicate field.
<br>The system moves that record to the left.
<li>To replace a field in the primary record with a field from a secondary record, use the left arrow button. 
<li>Click <span class="helpButton">Save Merge</span>. 
<br>The system merges the selected fields, moves all the related information to the primary record, and deletes the duplicate records.
