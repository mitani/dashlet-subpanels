<h1>Meetings</h1>

<p>
Use the Meetings page to schedule a meeting, search for, and invite users that you want to include in the meeting. You can only view schedules of those users who have shared their calendar with you in the Scheduling sub-panel.</p>
<p>
When you create the meeting, you must enter required information such as the subject, start time, date, and the meeting status.</p>
<ul>
<li>To indicate the item record related to the meeting, select the item from the drop-down list and enter the record name in the adjoining field. 
<li>To select the record from the Item list, click <span class="helpButton">Select</span>.
<li>To set a reminder to alert users when the meeting is due, select the <span class="helpButton">Reminder</span> box. The system displays a pop-up reminder in users' browser when the meeting is due.
