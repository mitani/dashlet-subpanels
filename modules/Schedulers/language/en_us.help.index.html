<h1>Scheduler</h1>

<p>Use this page to view existing jobs such as running reports and sending out campaign emails. The Scheduler integrates with external UNIX systems and Windows systems to run jobs that are scheduled through those systems, using either Cron (UNIX, Linux, BSD) or Schedule tasks (Windows). </p>
<p>You can schedule the following jobs:</p>
<ul>




<li><span class="helpButton">Prune Tracker Tables</span>. This job deletes older activity data.
<li><span class="helpButton">Check Inbound Mailboxes.</span> This job monitors inbound Emails in active mailboxes that you set up using the Inbound Email option in the Email panel of the Admin page.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Run Nightly Process Bounced Email Campaigns.</span> This job polls any mailbox in which, the "Possible Actions" parameter is set to "Bounce Handling". This is an essential component of monitoring mass email campaigns.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns.</span> This job processes the outbound email queue for your organization's mass campaign Emails.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Prune Database on 1st of Month.</span> This job reads all the tables in your Sugar database, finds records that have been soft-deleted, creates a large SQL file, and physically deletes those records. This job enhances performance but is not essential to the use of Sugar. The backup files are placed in cache/backups with time-stamped filenames.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Update Tracker Session Tables</span>. This job sets the status of timed-out sessions.
</ul>
<p>To export one or more scheduler definitions in a .csv file format to a local machine, select them from the list and click Export.
<p>To view the details of a scheduler, click its name in the list. On the detail page, click the appropriate button to edit, duplicate, or delete a job.</p>

For UNIX and Linux systems, you will need to add a new Cronjob to your Crontab. For Microsoft Windows, you can use the Task Scheduler.
