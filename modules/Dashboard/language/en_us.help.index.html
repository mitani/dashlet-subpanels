<h1>Dashboard</h1>


<p>Use the Dashboard module to view and manage charts based on custom and pre-defined reports.</p><br>

<p>You can use these charts to view sales and opportunities for your organization. Each distinctively colored area on a chart is linked to the data set that it represents. 
You can click any colored area to drill down to the underlying data.</p><br>





To add a new chart, click the down arrow on the dashboard tab and select <span class="helpButton">Add Sugar Dashlets</span>. From the Add Sugar Dashlets menu that displays in a separate window, select a chart to add it to your dashboard.<br><br> 

<p>The Dashboard Home displays the following pre-defined charts:
<ul>
<li><span class="helpButton">Pipeline By Sales Stage</span>. A funnel chart that displays the total dollar amounts for all your opportunities grouped by sales stage.
<li><span class="helpButton">All Opportunities by Lead Source</span>. A pie chart that shows the proportion of total sales opportunities for each lead source.
<li><span class="helpButton">All Opportunities by Lead Source by Outcome</span>. A horizontal stacked bar chart that shows total opportunities for each lead source. Each bar is made up of multi-colored segments which represent the outcome proportions for that lead source.</li>
<li><span class="helpButton">Outcome by Month</span>. A stacked bar chart where each bar shows the total sales pipeline for each month. Each bar is made up of multi-colored segments which represent the outcome proportions for the pipeline in that month.</li> 
</ul>











<p>
You can manage charts as follows:
<ul>
<li>To edit a chart, click the <b>Edit</b> icon at the top right corner of the chart.  Make the necessary changes and click <span class="helpButton">Submit</span>.
<li>To ensure that the chart is displaying the latest data, click the <b>Refresh</b> icon at the top right-hand corner of the chart. 
<li>To change the order in which the charts are displayed, select the chart title and drag and drop the chart at the desired location. Alternatively, click the down arrow on the Dashboard tab and select <b>Change Layout</b>. 
<li>To remove a chart from the dashboard, click the <b>Delete</b> icon at the top right-hand corner of the chart.
<li>To rename a Dashboard page, click the down arrow on the Dashboard tab and select <b>Rename Page</b>. The Dashboard tab turns into a text field in which you can enter a new name for the page.
